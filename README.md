# SleepBoard

This very simple web app allows to track sleep habits throughout time.  
All of the data is stored in a single `.csv` file, to ensure maximum portability.  
Set it up on your server by cloning the repository and installing dependencies:
```
git clone git@github.com:ronan-lebas/SleepBoard.git
cd SleepBoard/
# Make a venv and activate it!
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And start it with `python3 app.py`.
